I was a volunteer of Computer litercay program in National service scheme(NSS) [chapter at BITS Pilani](http://www.nssbitspilani.org/) till my third semester of college. I taught basic computer skills like MS word, excel, paint, google translate and using internet to underpriviliged children from a village nearby to the campus. Beginning with teching on our own systems, I led a team for a door-to door fund collection drive in the locality. We also started operating a computer lab with refurbished computers arranged by these funds in the community centre of the village. The children faced with a communication barrier of english on using computer programs, I initiated a system of using google translate to help ease the language gap and also accelerate learning.
