Working with Dr. [Döndü Sahin](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/physics/people/dondu-sahin/index.html) on optimising ultrathin superconducting films for my master's thesis, I gained valuable clean room experience on variety of instruments. In the last two months, she also gave me the responsibility to teach the lab component of nanofabrication course to four PhD students from QECDT first year cohort. As a teaching assistant my role was to teach the clean room procedures, equipments, processes inside the clean-room and finally complete some sample depositions for each student. During this time I independently taught in the lab, while my supervisor took the theory component helping me to plan the teaching in advance. This role allowed me to dive deeper into the the learning process to be able to teach and supervise.
