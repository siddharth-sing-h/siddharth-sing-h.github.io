<p>I did my first masters thesis in University of Bristol working in Quantum engineering centre for doctoral training ([QECDT](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/quantum-engineering/)) with Dr.Döndü Sahin. The objective was to optimise thin films made out of superconducting material.</p>

 <b> Fabrication </b>
 <p>The lab had a custom sputter system manufactured by a specialist manufacturer, with four targets specially designed to fabricate thin films at a faster thoughput. The manufacturer had gone bankrupt a year before my project leaving no technical assistance. The system had stalled because of technical glitches and repairs pending. We started troubleshooting the system at the start of my project, tackling multiple aspetcs of the system. We started with extensive cleaning of the chambers, repairing of the cooling lines, leak detection and seal changes, 
opening the vacuum pumps cleaning them and changing parts, removing sevearl auxillary systems as they had been malfunctioning, repairing electric motors which controlled the different motions inside the system and finally we also had to find the reason for flake formation. Extensive damage had been done due to misalignemnet and wrong triggers and overheating. After tackling all these problems along the way, I had gained valuable experience with the fabrication processes and how cleanroom works. This made me and my supervisor confident enough, that I started doing all the fabrication processes by myself in the cleanroom. This allowed me to find a recpie for superconducitng films. After extensive film fabrication, I was able to find a superconducting recpie on the system which allowed to reach new and higher transition temperature. I also worked with the cleanroom manager Dr.Andrew Murray on learning new instruments like wire bonding, ellipsiometer and SEM, this was done as part of my training to become a [teaching assistant](https://siddharth-sing-h.github.io/teaching/2015-spring-teaching-1) and pass down the same to Phd students, who would be taking the course.

<b>Dry-Cyrogenic system</b>
<p> To make measuremnts on the ultrathin films which were fabricated, I worked with Dr. Robert Heath, a senior postdoc in the group on taking measurements. I learnt extensively about using the DRY-ICE system, which could reach all the way to 1 K. I learnt about doing low tempearture measuremnts, designing breakout wires, learning the king of connectors and PCB's used. I started operating the full system with fair understanding after a period of 1 month doing measuremnts and did fast measurement cycles.   </p>

<b>Wet-cryogenic system</b>
<p>I took liquid nitrogen and helium, plus laser safety training to operate the measurement appartus. We preapred a cylindrical dewar fitted with four-point measuement pins with wiring and proper thermalisation appratus. The initial plan was to measure thin-films inside the dewar, but on availablity of drycryogenic system we made a make-shift plan to use that. </p>
