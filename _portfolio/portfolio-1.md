<p>I joined the SQD lab in January, 2020 for my master thesis project. Initially I was working in the lab, but as COVID pandemic hit, I returned home and the institution was closed for some time. I was fortunate enough to catch a flight back home, given the mass-migration that followed the lockdown anouncement. I started working back again to complete my thesis and changing the course of the thesis in such a way that instead of measurements we can do remote stuff. Starting november I have returned to the lab and have continued working on different projects, involving simulation, fabrication and learning measurements with the group during measurement cycles.</p>

 <b> Thesis </b>
 
<p> I worked on my Master's thesis titled - "Flux mediated coupling of a mechanical oscillator and Fluxonium qubit". I started with reading literature on circuit-QED and different types of qubits and about NEMS devices. The fluxonium has multiple energy levels and the spectrum changes with change in the magnetic flux. The change is accomplished by varying the magnetic field. If a mechanical oscillator can be integrated
