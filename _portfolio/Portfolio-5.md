Having studied physics and mechnaical engineering, I was trying to find my groove in undergrad. I knew I wanted to make something, but not sure what?

<b>Pilani</b>, it's a oasis amidst a desert. The desert had nothing to offer but it had all what I needed. It gifted me with the ability to find. 
To find the right person to get tutored from because I had barely gone to the calsses.
To finding lost questions hidden in previous year papers only on the last night, even when we had a month. 
"If you know exactly where you're headed, it's no fun at all", to find this quote hidden in an anime.
I found out that my desrie lies hidden in finding new things, be it as simple as finding a new grill to barbecue in a hailstorm.
