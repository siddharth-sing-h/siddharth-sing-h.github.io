Coronavirus pandemic with all it's challenges and uncertainities changed the work culture and provided me with an unique opportunity of working remotely with Prof. Ashok Ajoy. 
I started working in Ajoy lab in July,2020 and since then I have contributed in different components of making an Optical hyperpolariser which operates room temperature
