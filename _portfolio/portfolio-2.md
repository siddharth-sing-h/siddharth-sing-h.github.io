<p>Coronavirus pandemic with all it's challenges and uncertainities changed the work culture. During this period I got the opportunity of working remotely with Prof. Ashok Ajoy. 
I started working in Ajoy lab in July,2020 and since then I have contributed in different components of making an Optical hyperpolariser which operates at room temperature.</p>

<b>Increasing the Hyperpolarisation using more lasers</b>    
<p>The experiment requires to optically polasire the N-V centres present within a diamond. We used a coaxial multilayered ring stack to make a polyhedral structure, 
  which houses lasers. The mounting is made in a way to allow lasers to be focused at the centroid of the multilayer stack  and place a chip at that point. Microwave excitation 
  in-tandem transfers the polarisation form the spin to nuclei. My design led to a significant increase in the SNR and allowed more lasers to be focused on the diamond. Higher 
number of lasers meant more N-V centres could be opticlaly polarised.</p>

<b>Thermal simulation</b>    
<p>The laser excitation of the chip generates a significant amount of heat. To understand the cooling and model the heat transfer processes,
  I used COMSOL to accurately get thermal distribution in the structure.</p>

<b>Optical simulation</b>    
<p>Laser rays travel from the fibre tip coupler tothe diamond, going through several media and ultimately ending up in the diamond.To understand the isotropic optical excitation, 
  I used COMSOL to model this process and see the amount of heat transfered from the laser to the chip surface.</p>
