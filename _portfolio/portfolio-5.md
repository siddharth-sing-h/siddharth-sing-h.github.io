Having studied physics and mechnaical engineering, I was trying to find my groove in undergrad. I knew I wanted to make something, but not sure what?

<b>Pilani</b>, it's a oasis amidst a desert. The desert had nothing to offer but it trained me for all I needed. It gifted me with the ability to find. 
To find the right person to get tutored from because I had barely gone to the calsses of a particular course.
To finding lost questions hidden in previous year papers only on the last night, even when we had a month. 
"If you know exactly where you're headed, it's no fun at all", to find this quote hidden in an anime. To finding makeshift tools to make a car. 
I found out that my desrie lies hidden in finding new things, be it as simple as finding a new grill to barbecue in a hailstorm.

As soon as I heard someone telling me that there is a person who can show you atoms, I was all in with the idea. It was Prof. Deshdeep sahadev, founder of Quazar Technologies and a retired professor from IIT Kanpur. He had visited our campus and gave a talk on the devices they were building with the team at Quazar. Scanning tunneling microscope(STM) is a difficult thing to master when you want perfect pictures, but these guys had built one. Inspired by his philosophy and the sheer enthusiasm, I interned at Quazar technologies just after my third year. It was the best thing I could have done to get to know what I liked. The major difference came when I could actually implement my ideas on hardware.
