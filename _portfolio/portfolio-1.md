<p>I joined the SQD lab in January, 2020 for my master thesis project. Initially I was working in the lab, but as COVID pandemic hit, I returned home and the institution was closed for some time. I was fortunate enough to catch a flight back home, given the mass-migration that followed the lockdown anouncement. I started working back again to complete my thesis and changing the course of the thesis in such a way that we can do remote work. Starting november I have returned to the lab and have continued working on different projects, involving simulation, fabrication and learning measurements with the group during measurement cycles.</p>

 <b> Flux mediated coupling of a mechanical oscillator and Fluxonium qubit </b>
 
We developed on the idea ([arxiv.org/abs/2001.05700](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05700))  of changing flux without changing magnetic field, by integrating a mechanical oscillator in the SQUID loop though which we are flux-biasing a fluxonium qubit.
