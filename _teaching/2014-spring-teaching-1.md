I was a volunteer of Computer litercay program in National service scheme(NSS) [chapter at BITS Pilani](http://www.nssbitspilani.org/) till my third semester of college.  
I taught basic computer skills like MS word, excel, paint, google translate and using internet to underpriviliged children from a village nearby to the campus.

At the start I tried teaching the programs from my laptop but later I lead a door-to-door collection drive, so that the children have a computer lab where they can come and learn on fixed systems. It was difficult to convince parents that this lab would be impactful for their children, but we persisted and finally were able to collect enough funds and set up a lab in the community centre of the village. I faced difficulty with teaching children because they had inadequate knowledge of English so I came up with the idea of forming a structured teaching way using google translate to teach, so that they can explore the internet and learn more things by themselves, but the village did not have any internet connection and the mobile internet was too slow. With the limited mobile connections our team had, I figured out a way, by building a game with rewards to accelerate learning. Children were divided in teams in such a way that the older children were taught first to use google translate to complete tasks and then told to disseminate this knowledge among their juniors. The teams which had the greatest number of children able to complete the tasks were rewarded. It proved to be a great idea and when the internet access boomed throughout India in 2016, the village children had a very high literacy to use the internet and I was delighted to know that I had played a part.
